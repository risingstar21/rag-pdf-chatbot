# rag-pdf-chatbot
This project is a PDF-powered chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer user questions based on content from an uploaded PDF. It uses LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers (flan-t5-base), and Streamlit to provide an interactive UI. No Hugging Face API token required â€” runs entirely locally.
